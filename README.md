Welcome to Applied Quantitative Methods
=======================================

This site contains the teaching materials for the course Applied Quantitative
Methods. The course is aimed at developing a small set of core skills in
quantitative methods, and providing students an opportunity to apply these tools
towards their own projects.

I plan to add a better front-end webpage to provide better access to these
teaching materials, but for now this repo serves the purpose.
