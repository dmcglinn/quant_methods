Course Description:
-------------------
This course is a three hour seminar for graduate and advanced undergraduate
students. The goals of the course are to expose students to more advanced and
applied topics in statistical analyses, as well as, provide students the
opportunity to apply these methods to their own projects.  

Course Structure:
----------------
The course will be roughly divided in half between time spend learning about
tools and time spend developing one's own project.

Course Objectives:
------------------
1. To develop knowledge and exposure to modern quantitative methods such as (but
  not limited to):
    - R programming
    - Version control
    - Database SQL
    - GIS tools
    - Spatial statistics
    - Multivariate Statistics
2. To develop a project using some combination or these tools to addresses a
   scientific question.
3. To improve oral presentation and peer-teaching skills

Student Evaluation:
-------------------
**Graduate Students** will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* 5% Participation
* 5% Peer Teaching
* 45% Assignments
* 45% Project
    - 15% oral presentation
    - 15% project code
    - 15% written description of analysis (e.g., Methods and Results section of
       a paper)

**Undergraduate Students** will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* 5% Participation
* 45% Assignments
* 50% Project
    - 25% oral presentation
    - 25% project code


**_Project_** - The project in this course may span a wide range of potential
topics to be discussed as the course progresses.

Course Policies:
---------------

**_Class time_** - Our time in class will be used primarily for 1) learning
new quantitative methods, 2) working on exercises, 3) presenting to the rest of
the class, and 4) developing student projects.

**_Assignments_** - Most weeks during the first half of the semester there will
be a homework assignment associated with the content learned in lecture. Your
code and a written explanation of your solution are required. Although I
encourage collaboration on code development, your explanation of your solution
should be written in your own words. The assignment should be submitted via
email to mcglinndj@cofc.edu with the subject line: Programming Assignment X,
where X is the number of the assignment. One problem from each assignment
(selected at my discretion after the assignments have been submitted) will
receive a thorough code review and a detailed grade. Other problems will be
graded as follows:

* Produces the correct answer using the requested approach: 100%
* Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an incorrect
  answer: 90%
* Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core concept:
  50%
* Answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the core concept: 0%

Late assignments will be docked 20% and will not be accepted after Sunday Night
at 11:59 pm Eastern Time except in cases of genuine emergencies that can be
documented by the student or in cases where this has been discussed and approved
in advance. This policy is based on the idea that in order to learn how to
program well students should be programming at least every other day. Time has
been allotted in class for working on assignments and you are expected to work
on them outside of class. It is intended that you should have finished as much
of the assignment as you can based on what we have covered in class by the
following class period. Therefore, even if something unexpected happens at the
last minute you should already be close to done with the assignment. It also
allows me to provide rapid feedback by returning assignments quickly, which is
crucial to learning.

Final grades will be assigned based on the following scale:

- **A 93-100**
- **A- 90-92**
- **B+ 87-89**
- **B 83-86**
- **B- 80-82**
- **C+ 77-79**
- **C 73-76**
- **C- 70-72**
- **D+ 67-69**
- **D 60-66**
- **F \<60**

**_Students with Disabilities and Special Needs_** - The College will make
reasonable accommodations for persons with documented disabilities. If you have
a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are
encouraged to contact the Center for Disability Services (CDS/SNAP program)
located in the Lightsey Center, Suite 104, 953-1431, SNAP@cofc.edu. If you have
a documented disability and need accommodations, please come talk with me and
bring your Professor Notification Letter (PNL) as soon as possible. SNAP
students are requested to make arrangements with the instructors well in advance
of exams.

**_Academic integrity_** – Academic integrity is essential at the College of
Charleston and to the practice of science.  You will therefore be held to a high
standard of integrity in this course.  Plagiarism, lying, cheating or attempted
cheating are violations of the College’s honor code.  Any honor code violations
that occur will be handled as outlined in the student handbook.  Please be
absolutely sure that you understand what the honor code requires of you (see
pages 10-12 of the student handbook,
<http://cofc.edu/generaldocuments/handbook.pdf>).   If you have any questions or
concerns about honor code expectations or about how to avoid violations, please
consult with the instructor.

**_Plagiarism_** - Plagiarism is any use of words or ideas produced by another
person without proper attribution, and includes failing to paraphrase
adequately or to cite sources properly.  Plagiarism, both intentional and
unintentional, is forbidden by the honor code.  Please consult the instructor
if you have any questions or concerns about how to use and cite sources to
avoid plagiarism.

**_Collaboration_** - Many of your assignments will involve working with
other students.  Nevertheless, the work you submit must be completed
independently and must represent your own independent ideas, unless the
instructor specifically requires a joint product.  Please be sure that you
understand the distinction between collaborating and copying; ask your
instructor if you have any doubts. Suspicions of unauthorized collaboration will
be dealt with according to the honor code.

**_Re-using work_** - Please be aware that using work that you or anyone else
 has done for this or any other class or project, either in whole or in part, is
 a violation of the honor code, even if the work is revised.  Biology 211
 instructors keep copies of assignments submitted by students in previous
 semesters, and reuse or revision of such will result in reporting to the Dean
 of Students.
