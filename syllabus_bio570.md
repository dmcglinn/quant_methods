Course Overview:
----------------
Programming and applied statistics are critical tools for scientists in this
information age. This course is designed to introduce graduate students to
programming and statistical analysis using the R language. Students will learn
how to create reproducible workflows for importing, filtering, and statistically
modeling data. This course will help students that are pursing futures in data
science and graduate research.

Course Description:
-------------------
The course is split into two halves. The first half focuses on gaining
familiarity with R programming and version control for backing up code and
developing a reproducible and robust workflow for quantitative analysis. Then we
will transition into modeling with a focus on uni- and multi-variate response
variables. Students will also gain familiarity with more advanced topics such as
carrying out GIS operations, developing models that include spatial
autocorrelation, and building simulations. The second half of the course is
focused on student projects which will be evaluated on a weekly basis
culminating in a peer-code review, oral presentation, and scientific paper.


Course Structure:
----------------
The course will be roughly divided in half between time spend learning about
tools and time spend developing one’s own project.

Student Learning Objectives:
---------------------------
In this course students will:

1. Learn to read and write R code using conditionals (if/else), loops, and
functions. 
2. Use the git version control system and be able to backup their code to the
cloud.
3. Understand the assumptions and the interpretation of statistical models.
4. Be able to create and interpret graphics in the R environment.
5. Gain an understanding of data structures in GIS and how to use R
to manipulate and map that data. 
6. Use existing data and statistical methods to address their own research
question over a multi-week research project.
7. Communicate the results of their statistical analyses in written reports,
oral presentations, and a scientific paper.
8. Gain mentorship skills by engaging in peer-mentoring inclass and via
peer-code review.

Student Evaluation:
-------------------
**Graduate Students** will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* 5% Participation including peer-mentorship
* 5% Quizzes
* 40% Assignments
* 50% Project
    - 10% project code
    - 20% oral presentation
    - 20% written description of analysis (e.g., Methods and Results section of
       a paper)


**_Project_** - The project in this course may span a wide range of potential
topics including the analysis of data (collected by the student or a 3rd party),
development of software (e.g., R shiny app or R package), and simulation
modeling. The project must include a problem that can be addressed
quantitatively. Students will develop their project in consultation with the
instructor, and they will receive feedback early on in project development from
their fellow classmates after a formal in class project pitch. At the end of the
semester, the students' will submit their code for formal code review by their
classmates and each student will deliver an oral presentation on their project
findings.

More information on the project assignments and examples of past projects can be
found on the [Projects](http://dmcglinn.github.io/quant_methods/projects) page.

**Code and Written project components due Friday of Week 14** 

Course Policies:
---------------

**_Required Materials_** - Access to a computer in which the free software R and
Rstudio. A laptop computer will be helpful but is not required as the instructor
will provide a university laptop to each student during class time as needed.

**_Class time_** - Our time in class will be used primarily for 1) learning
new quantitative methods, 2) working on exercises, 3) presenting to the rest of
the class, 4) developing student projects, and 5) engaging in peer-teaching.

**_Attendance Policy_** - You are expected to attend class and arrive on time and 
prepared for that days lesson. Failure to attend class or to be prepared will 
negatively impact your participation grade in the class. 

**_Assignments_** - Most weeks during the first half of the semester there will
be a homework assignment associated with the content learned in lecture. Your
code and a written explanation of your solution are required. Although I
encourage collaboration on code development, your explanation of your solution
should be written in your own words. The assignment should be submitted via the 
appropriate OAKs dropbox. One problem from each assignment (selected at my
discretion after the assignments have been submitted) will receive a thorough
code review and a detailed grade. Other problems will be graded as follows:

* Produces the correct answer using the requested approach: 100%
* Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an incorrect
  answer: 90%
* Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core concept:
  50%
* Answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the core concept: 0%

Typically assignments will be due on Friday morning. 
Late assignments will be docked 5% per day and will not be accepted after Monday
night at 11:59 pm Eastern Time except in cases of genuine emergencies that can be
documented by the student or in cases where this has been discussed and approved
in advance. This policy is based on the idea that in order to learn how to
program well students should be programming at least every other day. Time has
been allotted in class for working on assignments and you are expected to work
on them outside of class. It is intended that you should have finished as much
of the assignment as you can based on what we have covered in class by the
following class period. Therefore, even if something unexpected happens at the
last minute you should already be close to done with the assignment. It also
allows me to provide rapid feedback by returning assignments quickly, which is
crucial to learning.

Final grades will be assigned based on the following scale:

**Graduate Students**

| Letter | Grade                              | % Points | Quality Points | 
|--------|------------------------------------|----------|----------------| 
| A      | Superior                           | 90 - 100 | 4              | 
| B+     | Very Good                          | 87 - 90  | 3.5            | 
| B      | Good                               | 80 - 87  | 3              | 
| C+     | Fair                               | 77 - 80  | 2.5            | 
| C      | Acceptable                         | 70 - 77  | 2              | 
| F      | Failure                            | 60 - 70  | 0              | 
| XF     | Failure Due to Academic Dishonesty |          | 0              | 
| RA-RF  | Repeat; include GPA/exclude hours  |          |                | 


**_Students with Disabilities and Special Needs_** - Any student eligible for
and needing accommodations because of a disability is requested to speak with
the professor during the first two weeks of class or as soon as the student has
been approved for services so that reasonable accommodations can be arranged.
Center for Disability Services located in the Lightsey Center, Suite 104,
953-1431, SNAP@cofc.edu. If you have a documented disability and need
accommodations, please come talk with me and bring your Professor Notification
Letter (PNL) as soon as possible.

**_Academic integrity_** - Lying, cheating, attempted cheating, and plagiarism
are violations of our Honor Code that, when suspected, are investigated. Each
incident will be examined to determine the degree of deception involved.
Incidents where the instructor determines the student’s actions are related more
to misunderstanding and confusion will be handled by the instructor. The
instructor designs an intervention or assigns a grade reduction to help prevent
the student from repeating the error. The response is recorded on a form and
signed both by the instructor and the student. It is forwarded to the Office of
the Dean of Students and placed in the student’s file.

Cases of suspected academic dishonesty will be reported directly by the
instructor and/or others having knowledge of the incident to the Dean of
Students. A student found responsible by the Honor Board for academic dishonesty
will receive a XXF in the course, indicating failure of the course due to
academic dishonesty. This status indicator will appear on the student’s
transcript for two years after which the student may petition for the XX to be
expunged. The F is permanent. 

Students can find the complete Honor Code and all
related processes in the Student Handbook at:
http://deanofstudents.cofc.edu/honor-system/studenthandbook/

**_Plagiarism_** - Plagiarism is any use of words or ideas produced by another
person without proper attribution, and includes failing to paraphrase adequately
or to cite sources properly. Plagiarism, both intentional and unintentional, is
forbidden by the honor code. Please consult the instructor if you have any
questions or concerns about how to use and cite sources to avoid plagiarism.

**_Collaboration_** - Many of your assignments will involve working with other
students. Nevertheless, the work you submit must be completed independently and
must represent your own independent ideas, unless the instructor specifically
requires a joint product. Please be sure that you understand the distinction
between collaborating and copying; ask your instructor if you have any doubts.
Suspicions of unauthorized collaboration will be dealt with according to the
honor code.

**_Re-using work_** - Please be aware that using work that you or anyone else
has done for this or any other class or project, either in whole or in part, is
a violation of the honor code, even if the work is revised.

**_OAKS_** - OAKS, including Gradebook, will be used for this course throughout the semester to provide the syllabus and class materials and grades for each assignment, which will be regularly posted. The official course webpage will be used for disseminating lecture materials.

**_Inclement Weather, Pandemic or Substantial Interruption of Instruction_** -
If in-person classes are suspended, faculty will announce to their students a
detailed plan for a change in modality to ensure the continuity of learning. All
students must have access to a computer equipped with a web camera, microphone,
and Internet access. Resources are available to provide students with these
essential tools.

**_Mental & Physical Wellbeing_** - At the college, we take every students’
mental and physical wellbeing seriously. If you find yourself experiencing
physical illnesses, please reach out to student health services (843.953.5520).
And if you find yourself experiencing any mental health challenges (for example,
anxiety, depression, stressful life events, sleep deprivation, and/or
loneliness/homesickness) please consider contacting either the Counseling Center
(professional counselors at http://counseling.cofc.edu or 843.953.5640 3rd
Robert Scott Small Building) or the Students 4 Support (certified volunteers
through texting “4support” to 839863, visit
http://counseling.cofc.edu/cct/index.php, or meet with them in person 3rd Floor
Stern Center). These services are there for you to help you cope with
difficulties you may be experiencing and to maintain optimal physical and mental
health.

**_Food & Housing Resources_** - Many CofC students report experiencing food and
housing insecurity. If you are facing challenges in securing food (such as not
being able to afford groceries or get sufficient food to eat every day) and
housing (such as lacking a safe and stable place to live), please contact the
Dean of Students for support (http://studentaffairs.cofc.edu/about/salt.php).
Also, you can go to
http://studentaffairs.cofc.edu/student-food-housing-insecurity/index.php to
learn about food and housing assistance that is available to you. In addition,
there are several resources on and off campus to help. You can visit the Cougar
Pantry in the Stern Center (2nd floor), a student-run food pantry that provides
dry-goods and hygiene products at no charge to any student in need. Please also
consider reaching out to Professor ABC if you are comfortable in doing so.
